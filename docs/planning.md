# Planning & Requirements


Every great project starts with a problem worth solving. Let me take you back to where this all began.


## The Problem

It was late October 2024, and I was drowning in research papers. I was trying to stay current with advances in transformer architectures, RAG systems, and multi-agent frameworks - but new papers were being published faster than I could read them.

I'd spend hours:
- Searching across arXiv, Semantic Scholar, PubMed
- Copying paper titles and abstracts into notes
- Trying to remember which paper mentioned what concept
- Re-reading papers because I forgot their key insights

**There had to be a better way.**

## The Vision

I imagined a research assistant that could:

1. **Automatically collect** papers from multiple sources based on my interests
2. **Build a knowledge graph** showing how papers, authors, and concepts relate
3. **Answer my questions** by synthesizing information across papers
4. **Remember our conversations** so I don't have to repeat context
5. **Scale** from my laptop to production without rewriting code

But I didn't want to build just another prototype. I wanted something that demonstrated **production-grade patterns** I could use in real applications.

## Core Requirements

I broke this down into functional and non-functional requirements.



### Functional Requirements

**Data Collection**
- ✅ Support multiple data sources (academic databases, web search)
- ✅ Automatic deduplication of papers
- ✅ Scheduled/automated collection in background
- ✅ Rate limiting and error handling

**Knowledge Organization**
- ✅ Knowledge graph with entities (papers, authors, topics)
- ✅ Relationships (authored, cites, is_about)
- ✅ Vector embeddings for semantic search
- ✅ Graph visualization

**Query & Reasoning**
- ✅ Natural language question answering
- ✅ Multi-hop reasoning across papers
- ✅ Source citation with paper references
- ✅ Conversation memory (5-turn history)

**Session Management**
- ✅ Multiple research sessions
- ✅ Save/load session state
- ✅ Session statistics and metadata

**User Interface**
- ✅ Modern, responsive web interface
- ✅ Data collection controls
- ✅ Interactive graph visualization
- ✅ Chat interface for queries





### Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance**
- Data collection: < 2 minutes for 10+ papers
- Query answering: < 5 seconds
- Graph queries: < 100ms
- Vector search: < 100ms

**Reliability**
- 99% uptime for production deployment
- Graceful degradation if services unavailable
- Automatic retries with exponential backoff
- Circuit breakers for external APIs

**Scalability**
- Support 1000+ papers in knowledge base
- Handle concurrent users in production
- Horizontal scaling with Kafka
- Efficient caching to reduce costs

**Maintainability**
- 90%+ test coverage
- Type safety with TypeScript/Pydantic
- Clear separation of concerns
- Comprehensive documentation

**Cost Efficiency**
- Intelligent model selection (use cheapest model for each task)
- Caching to avoid redundant API calls
- Token budgets to prevent runaway costs
- Target: < $10/month for moderate usage



## Choosing the Tech Stack

This was one of the most important decisions. I needed technologies that were:
- **Mature** enough for production
- **Well-documented** so I could move fast
- **Composable** so I could swap components
- **Cost-effective** to run

Here's how I evaluated each component:

### LLM Provider

**Candidates**: OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini

**Winner**: **Google Gemini 2.0 Flash**

**Why?**
- ✅ Fast response times (< 2s average)
- ✅ Cost-effective ($0.35 per 1M tokens)
- ✅ Large context window (1M tokens)
- ✅ Good reasoning capabilities
- ✅ Free tier for development

I experimented with all three, and Gemini gave the best balance of speed, cost, and quality for research Q&A.

### Orchestration Framework

**Candidates**: LangChain, LangGraph, Custom

**Winner**: **LangGraph**

**Why?**
- ✅ Built for multi-agent workflows
- ✅ Excellent state management
- ✅ Visual workflow debugging
- ✅ Works seamlessly with LlamaIndex
- ✅ Good documentation and examples

LangChain was too linear for my multi-agent pattern. LangGraph gave me the graph-based orchestration I needed.

### RAG Framework

**Candidates**: LlamaIndex, Haystack, Custom

**Winner**: **LlamaIndex**

**Why?**
- ✅ Best-in-class retrieval strategies
- ✅ Flexible architecture
- ✅ Great integration with vector DBs
- ✅ Built-in evaluation tools
- ✅ Active community

LlamaIndex saved me weeks of work on chunking strategies, embedding management, and retrieval optimization.

### Knowledge Graph

**Candidates**: Neo4j, NetworkX, TigerGraph

**Winner**: **Both Neo4j AND NetworkX** (dual backend)

**Why?**
- ✅ Neo4j for production (persistent, scalable, visual)
- ✅ NetworkX for development (fast startup, no infrastructure)
- ✅ Same API for both (abstraction layer)
- ✅ Easy switching via environment variables

This was a game-changer. I could develop and test on my laptop with NetworkX, then deploy to production with Neo4j without changing code.

### Vector Database

**Candidates**: Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant, FAISS

**Winner**: **Both Qdrant AND FAISS** (dual backend)

**Why?**
- ✅ Qdrant for production (persistent, REST API, dashboard)
- ✅ FAISS for development (in-memory, no setup)
- ✅ Same abstraction layer
- ✅ Cost: $0 (self-hosted Qdrant)

Again, dual backends gave me the flexibility to move fast in development and scale in production.

### Event Streaming

**Candidates**: Kafka, RabbitMQ, Redis Streams

**Winner**: **Kafka** (optional)

**Why?**
- ✅ Industry standard for event-driven systems
- ✅ Event persistence and replay
- ✅ Horizontal scaling with consumer groups
- ✅ Rich ecosystem (Kafka UI, connectors)
- ✅ Optional: falls back to sync mode if unavailable

I made Kafka optional because it's overkill for development but essential for production scalability.

### ETL Orchestration

**Candidates**: Airflow, Prefect, Dagster

**Winner**: **Apache Airflow**

**Why?**
- ✅ Industry standard for data pipelines
- ✅ Visual DAG editor and monitoring
- ✅ Automatic retries and error handling
- ✅ Scalable with Celery workers
- ✅ Rich integrations

Airflow gave me 3-4x faster data collection through parallel execution and automatic retries.

### Frontend

**Candidates**: Next.js, Vite+React, SvelteKit

**Winner**: **Vite + React + TypeScript**

**Why?**
- ✅ Lightning fast dev server (< 1s HMR)
- ✅ React ecosystem and component libraries
- ✅ TypeScript for type safety
- ✅ Lightweight (no SSR overhead)
- ✅ Easy deployment

I didn't need SSR for this app, so Vite's simplicity and speed won.

## Architecture Philosophy

I made some key architectural decisions early on:



### 1. Dual-Backend Strategy

**Problem**: Setting up Neo4j, Qdrant, and Kafka for development is slow and resource-heavy.

**Solution**: Abstract backends behind interfaces, provide in-memory alternatives.

**Benefits**:
- ⚡ Instant startup in development (0s vs 30s)
- 🧪 Faster test suite (no Docker overhead)
- 💰 Lower cloud costs (single container vs 7)
- 🔄 Easy switching via env vars





### 2. Multi-Agent Pattern

**Problem**: A single monolithic agent becomes complex and hard to test.

**Solution**: Separate concerns into specialized agents coordinated by an orchestrator.

**Benefits**:
- 🧩 Clear separation of concerns
- 🧪 Easier unit testing
- 🔄 Can replace individual agents
- 📈 Can scale agents independently





### 3. Event-Driven Communication

**Problem**: Synchronous agent calls create tight coupling and bottlenecks.

**Solution**: Agents publish events to Kafka; consumers process asynchronously.

**Benefits**:
- ⚡ Parallel processing (3x faster)
- 🔌 Loose coupling
- 🔄 Event replay for debugging
- 📈 Horizontal scaling





### 4. Production-Grade Patterns

From day one, I implemented patterns that would matter at scale:

**Circuit Breakers**: Prevent cascade failures when APIs go down
```python
@circuit_breaker(failure_threshold=5, recovery_timeout=60)
def call_external_api():
    ...
```

**Token Budgets**: Prevent runaway LLM costs
```python
@token_budget(per_request=10000, per_user=100000)
def generate_answer():
    ...
```

**Intelligent Caching**: 40% cost reduction with dual-tier cache
```python
@cache(ttl=3600, strategy="dual-tier")
def expensive_operation():
    ...
```

**Dynamic Model Selection**: Use cheapest model that meets requirements
```python
model = select_model(task_type="summarization", max_latency=2.0)
```

## Lessons from Planning

Looking back, here's what I learned:

**✅ What Worked**

1. **Dual-backend strategy was brilliant** - Saved hours of dev time
2. **Starting with requirements** - Kept me focused
3. **Choosing mature tech** - Less debugging, more building
4. **Production patterns from day 1** - No painful refactoring later

**🤔 What I'd Change**

1. **Should have added Airflow earlier** - Parallel collection is much faster
2. **Could have started with fewer data sources** - 3 would have been enough to validate
3. **Frontend design took longer than expected** - Glassmorphism is tricky to get right

**💡 Key Insights**

> The best architecture is one that lets you move fast in development and scale in production without rewriting code.

> Abstractions are worth the upfront cost when they give you optionality.

> Production patterns implemented early save painful refactoring later.
